# Flask-CURD_API

Python Flask API Documentation
This is the documentation for the Python Flask API. The API is built using the Flask framework and provides a set of endpoints for accessing data.

Getting started
To get started with the API, you'll need to have Python and Flask installed on your machine. You can install Flask using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install Flask
Running the API
To run the API, navigate to the directory containing the app.py file and run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
This will start the API and it will be accessible at http://localhost:5000.

API endpoints
The API provides the following endpoints:

GET /users
This endpoint returns a list of all users in the system.

GET /users/{id}
This endpoint returns a specific user based on their ID.

POST /users
This endpoint allows you to create a new user.

PUT /users/{id}
This endpoint allows you to update an existing user.

DELETE /users/{id}
This endpoint allows you to delete a user based on their ID.

Request and Response Formats
Request
All endpoints accept and return data in JSON format. When making a request to the API, you should include the data in the request body in JSON format.

Response
All endpoints return data in JSON format. The response will include a status code and a JSON object containing the requested data.

Error Handling
In the event of an error, the API will return a JSON object containing an error message and a status code.

Authentication
This API does not currently require authentication.
